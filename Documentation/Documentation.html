      <h3>About my Project</h3>
      <p>I have built a simple library management system for the employess.
         In this they will be able to edit,delete and update the records of books in the library.
         It is a dynamic website in php and mysqland contains three pages.
         Login Page, SignUp Page and Main Page</p>

    </div>

    <div class="use">
      <h3>How to use my Website</h3>
      <p>To use my website firstly you have to signup for it with a valid email and password
        and the Password Should be of 8 characters or more. Than you have to enter that information
        in the Login form.By entering a valid information in the Login form you will be given access
        to the main page which will consist of a table with information about the books . Below the
        table there is a button called "add new records" clicking on which a form will appear in which
        you can fill a information about the book you want to add and then click the add button .
        The book will be added to the table</p>



  <p>On the last column of the table with the heading "Action" there are two subcolumns.
     The first on is "Delete" by clicking on which the records will be deleted from the table.
     The second one is "Edit" by clicking on which it will take you to a new page where you can
     edit the existing records.</p>
