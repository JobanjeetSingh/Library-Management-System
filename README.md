# Library-Management-System

As a part of my web developement course I build this library management system
To use this application you need to use xampp and run the sql file I have given in the folder.
After this open the index.php file to register with a valid email and strong password.
After registering you will be able to login as an emplyee.
After logging in you will be able to add new records of books to library database, update existing records and delete them.
Once you loggout you have to log in again with same password and email .
